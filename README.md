# Portfolio Projects: SQL and Python Solutions for Business Impact

Here, I'm showcasing two exciting projects where I used my skills to drive business value with data. Both projects, one built with SQL and the other with Python, highlight my ability to solve real-world problems with innovative solutions. Let's dive into the fun stuff!

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. SQL Project: Optimizing Business Performance with Data Queries 

In this project, I tackled complex business data challenges using SQL. My goal was to streamline the process of analyzing and extracting insights from large datasets, making the business decision-making process more efficient. Here‚Äôs what I did:

### Problem Solved:
The business was struggling to quickly access key metrics across various departments, resulting in delays and missed opportunities.

### Solution:
I wrote optimized SQL queries to improve data extraction, reporting, and analysis. From summarizing sales trends to identifying underperforming sectors, my queries helped create a crystal-clear view of the business performance.

## üé¨ 2. Python Project: Automating Data-Driven Insights with Python

This Python project is all about automating workflows to save time and increase accuracy in data processing. Using Python, I built a solution to automate repetitive tasks and turn data into actionable insights faster. Here‚Äôs the lowdown:

### Problem Solved:
The manual process of data cleaning and analysis was consuming hours of employee time, leading to bottlenecks and human errors.

### Solution:
I wrote Python scripts that automated data cleaning, transformed raw data into structured formats, and generated visual reports to help the team stay on top of key metrics.

## ü™Ä Amazon Web Scraping: Price Tracking and Email Alerts

 This fun little scraper monitors the price of a shirt on Amazon and lets you know when it‚Äôs time to make your purchase (just in case you‚Äôre waiting for a discount)!



### What Does It Do?
1. **Web Scraping**: Using Python and the **BeautifulSoup** library, I scrape the title and price of the shirt from the Amazon product page.
2. **Data Logging**: It saves the price and title to a CSV file, so you can see the price changes over time.
3. **Scheduled Monitoring**: The script runs every day (86400 seconds) to check for any price changes, logging the data automatically.
4. **Email Alerts**: If the price drops below a certain level, the script sends you an email (because who doesn‚Äôt like getting discounts in their inbox?)!

### How It Works:

- **Scraping**: The script grabs the product title and price from the Amazon page.
- **Data Logging**: It stores that data in a CSV file with a timestamp.
- **Scheduled Check**: The script runs once a day, checking the price, and appending new data to the CSV.
- **Email Alert**: When the price hits a certain threshold (e.g., below $15), you get an email letting you know it's time to buy!



- **BeautifulSoup** (for web scraping)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **SmtpLib** (for sending emails)
